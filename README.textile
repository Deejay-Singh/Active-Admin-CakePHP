h1. Active Admin for CakePHP

Based on Active Admin for RoR (http://activeadmin.info/). This plugin for CakePHP gives you the same administration interface for the PHP framework.

h2. Install

# Clone the project as "active_admin" into your apps plugins-folder
# Copy the active_admin/views/layouts/admin.ctp into your app's layout-folder

h3. Prepare your app's controllers

The Filter component is needed for filtering of records:

@var $components = array('ActiveAdmin.Filter');@

For the admin_index function:

@function admin_index() {
$this->paginate['Post']['order'] = array('Post.date' => 'desc');
$this->Post->recursive = 0;
// Add this 
$filter = $this->Filter->process($this);
$this->set('posts', $this->paginate(null, $filter));
}@

And update your view/(controller)/admin_index.ctp views, using a table-header element that enable table-sorting. See admin_amdin/docs/admin_index.ctp for that.
